  <h1>Week 2</h1>
  
  <p>When transcribing my pdf to MuseScore via the OMR engine, although majority of the notes were correct, I found multiple errors in terms of rhythm and tempo. 
    
    <ul>
      <li>Tempo speed was wrong. It displayed 120 when its supposed to be 168.</li>
      <li>Staccato dots were missing from multiple notes.</li>
      <li>Some notes were missing from the page and replaced by rests.</li>
      <li>More tempo speed signs missing.</li>
      <li>Type of note was wrong. E.g Crotchet instead of Quaver.</li>
      <li>Wrong rest type.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>In comparison to our group activity on Tuesday, the piece of music we selected had far more errors with large groups of notes missing from the page.</p>
