# Music Curation and Analytics Portfolio
Week 1: Basics of Music Data

Task 1: Identify a theme for Your Dataset

The theme I have identified for my project is Film Scores based on the works of Hans Zimmer. I have chosen this as my theme as I am fascinated by how film scores help tell the story, with some of my favourite scores from Pirates of the Caribbean and Inception composed by Hans Zimmer.

Hans Zimmer is a film scorer and music producer from Germany. He is known for movies such as The Lion King, Interstellar, Sherlock Holmes, Kung Fu Panda and more. He has won two Oscars, 4 Grammys and has been nominated for 3 Emmys and a Tony.
