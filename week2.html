        <p>When transcribing my pdf to MuseScore via the OMR engine, although the majority of the notes were correct, I found multiple errors in terms of rhythm and tempo.</p>
           
            <ul class="my-list-style">
                <li>Tempo speed was wrong. It displayed 120 when itâ€™s supposed to be 168.</li>
                <li>Staccato dots were missing from multiple notes.</li>
                <li>Some notes were missing from the page and replaced by rests.</li>
                <li>More tempo speed signs missing.</li>
                <li>Type of note was wrong, e.g., crotchet instead of quaver.</li>
                <li>Wrong rest type.</li>
            </ul>
            
        <p>In comparison to our group activity on Tuesday, the piece we had chosen had far more errors with large groups of notes missing from the page. This could be due to the pdf type. The score we had chosen was taken from an archive list. Whereas the piece I chose for this individual task, was a screenshot taken from the MuseScore website. This could mean that it was already in a format that the program could recognize.</p>

            <p>The images below show the comparison of the original piece and initial transcription, displaying the errors of the first 10 bars.</p>
