    <h2>Task 1: Extract features</h2>
    <p>For this task, I selected 3 audio tracks related to my theme.</p>

    <h3>They Crawl</h3>

    <h3>Time</h3>

  <section id="task2">
<div class="container">
    <h2>Task 2: Compute and visualize features with histograms</h2>
    <p>For this task, I used python to compute and visualize the histograms of the features for my three tracks.</p>

    <h3>Track 1: They Crawl</h3>
    <img src="data/images/thecrawl_mlcc.png" alt="They Crawl Spectrogram" width="700" height="700">
    
    <h3>Track 2: Time</h3>
    <img src="data/images/time_mlcc.png" alt="Time Spectrogram" width="700" height="700">
    
    <h3>Track 3: Now We Are Free</h3>
    <img src="data/images/nowwearefree_mlcc.png" alt="Now We Are Free Spectrogram" width="700" height="700">

    <p>To begin this reflection, I want to point out that although all 3 tracks are related to my theme, track 2 & 3 (Time and Now we are free) were both composed by Hans Zimmer, and They Crawl composed by Matt Oakley was a horror movie soundtrack I downloaded from the free music archive. That being said, I decided to compare the MFCC Histograms. As expected, tracks 2 & 3 are far more similar to each other compared to track 1. Graphs 12 - 15 of tracks 2 & 3 for example look very similar. As they are both by the same composer, this comes as no surprise as artists tend to have their own compositional techniques that they frequently use for composing music. When comparing graph 0 however, tracks 1 & 3 have greater similarity, which could be attributed to shared features that are more common in horror or suspense soundtracks. Graph 1 has the lowest similarity between all the tracks.</p>
