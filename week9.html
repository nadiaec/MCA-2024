    <h2>Task 1: Extract features</h2>
    <p>For this task, I selected 3 audio tracks related to my theme.</p>

    <h3>They Crawl</h3>

    <h3>Time</h3>

    <h3>Now We Are Free</h3>

    <p>One advantage of a time-frequency analysis over a waveform-based analysis is that it provides more detailed information that is easier to read and interpret. Waveform for example, only shows the amplitude variation and does not provide details of the frequency components that are present in each moment. Time-frequency however, shows information about the time, beat, timbre, along with frequency modulations and harmonic patterns. For example, in the time-frequency of the audio 'Time' from the previous task, the spectrogram shows us the gradual frequency build-up over time and the sudden release at the end. The spectrogram for 'Now we are here' is particularly interesting because it shows the distinct harmonic bands that may represent the vocal and instrumental components.</p>
