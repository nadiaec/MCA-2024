        <p>When comparing the 2 file types, I found that data in the MEI file was more detailed and precise. For example, the element <note> in MusicXML showed the attributes for rest, duration, voice, type and staff. However in MEI, in addition to these attributes, it shows pname. The children in both MusicXML and MEI include accidentals and octaves, however I found that articulation was shown only represented in the MEI file. The <note> element in this case seems to be more detailed in the MEI file perhaps making it more accommodating to various musical notations. The element <chord> is also more detailed in the MEI file. In the MusicXML file, the element doesnâ€™t have any children, whereas in the MEI file, the <chord> element includes duration, articulation, note, pname, and octave. The one element I did find to have more detail in the MusicXML file was <part-name>. In this file, the instrument used is more specific. It shows Piano, acoustic grand piano under instrument name, and keyboard piano under instrument sound. Overall, I think that the main difference between the two tile types is that MusicXML is more straightforward making it easy to read and software compatible whereas MEI allows for more precision and detail making it the better type for more complex musical notation.</p></div>
