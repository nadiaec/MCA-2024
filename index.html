        <h1>Basics of Music Data</h1>
    </header>

            <h2>Task 1: Identify a theme for your Dataset</h2>
                <p>The theme I have identified for my project are Film Scores based on the works of Hans Zimmer. I have chosen this as my theme because I am fascinated by how film scores help tell a story, with some of my favourite scores from Pirates of the Caribbean and Inception which were composed by Hans Zimmer</p>
                <p>Hans Zimmer is a film scorer and music producer from Germany. He is known for movies such as The Lion King, Intersteller, Sherlock Holmes, Kung Fu Panda and more. He has won two Oscars, 4 Grammys, and has been nominated for 3 Emmys and a Tony.</p>

            <h2>Task 2: Challenges</h2>
                <p>Based on my own experiences, one challenge to working with music and music-related data would be Access and Complexity . Music and music-related data can come in many different formats. Whether its the type of audio file (e.g mp3, WAV, FLAC) or type of music notation (e.g manuscripts, printed scores, computerised scores, encoded scores etc.) These types of music notation also have a range of different formats. For example, if we look at computerised scores, there are any different standards such as MIDI, MusicXML and musescore's format .mscz. Due to the amount of variations of music data it can be hard to curate and analyse as it is not guaranteed that all the music you need is in the same format. This means some formats have to be converted to another in order to analyse the music data in the same way, using the same software.</p> 
                <p>One specific challenge I will face with my selected theme of Film Scores by Hans Zimmer would be copyright. As the music I want to use are from films licenced by Disney, there may be copyright issues in relation to the usage of this music. If I were to use this in a different context, I understand that there would be copyright implications, however, I intend only to use it for educational purposes.</p>
